# map48-project

Sample data and code for the MAP48 project

## Getting started

I've provided two sample datasets in the `data` folder. `population_sample_data.csv` contains population data for a variety of ACS
variables for each [census_tract](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html). `time_series_sample_data.csv` 
contains the percent of population working from home by education level. Hopefully, these sample datasets will give you a sense of the types of data 
we typically work with. Codebooks for each dataset are also provided. In addition, I've provided code samples for both datasets to give an example of how the data could be modified and displayed.
